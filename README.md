# ENEL200 Project

This repository includes the group project that is part of the University of Canterbury's Second Year program for Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I completed this program in 2022 before I switched to Software Engineering in 2023.

Our group created a portable electronic device that would hopefully help combat the "she'll be 'right" attitude of New Zealander's to skin cancer. This has led to high levels of this deadly disease and we created a prototype of this device that would remind users in a frequent manner when to apply sunblock.

This project was partly repsonsible for my realisation that I was more interested in the software aspects of electronics. 
I took a large part of responsibility with producing the Arduino code for our project.

The codebase was very simple and not well refactored compared to the projects that followed in my software engineering degree. However, it was this experience that helped me make the change I needed to make in my life.

In the Arduino code, testing files ensured the functionality of physical components, helping isolate hardware or software issues. Lacking Git verison control education, we stored code versions in separate folders and maintaining a demo version for quicker feature demos due to time constraints.

For context with the project, I also included our final submission for our project's report and the presentation powerpoint.
